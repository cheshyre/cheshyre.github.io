title: Subbing Plans/Interests<br> For Spring 2016
layout: default
---
I am a lazy asshole, so I don't really want to organize or lobby to work on specific projects. Instead, I will document my interest in projects here and wait for people to ask me to work on their project. This makes it easier for both parties because it's clear what shows I want to work on and I don't end up bothering people that already have a typesetter/editor for projects I'd be interested in.

### Confirmed

- Haifuri
- flying witch (probably)

### Interested in

- My Hero Academia
- Bungou Stray Dogs
- Concrete Revolutio S2 (if season 1 is ever finished)
- JoJo S4 (seriously, I'll typeset this)
- Kiznaiver
- Kuma Miko
- Tanaka wa Itsumo Kedaruge
- Manaria Friends (Bahamut short)

Disclaimer: Chances are I will probably only take on one or two more projects in addition to the ones currently confirmed. So I'm definitely not subbing all of those.
