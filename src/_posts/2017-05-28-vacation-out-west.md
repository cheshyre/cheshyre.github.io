From May 5th to May 27th, I went on a vacation that started in the Bay Area and moved all the way to the canyon areas in Arizona and Utah and Las Vegas. Here are brief descriptions of the things I did and what I thought about them.

# Bay Area

I spent three days in San Francisco. I split my time between exploring downtown and visiting the various parks and recreation areas in the surrounding area.

## Fisherman's Wharf

Fisherman's Wharf is a tourist area on the bay in downtown San Francisco. It has a lot of restaurants, street performers, and other things. Getting to see the downtown bay area of San Francisco was interesting. On the other hand, I did not enjoy the amount of people or the lack of anything actually interesting to do. Walking back into the city to get dinner took me away from the wharf area and the tourists there, which was nice.

## Golden Gate Park

The Golden Gate Park is a park in downtown San Francisco that stretches from the center of the penninsula all the way to the Pacific coast. It has various sub-gardens for people with specific interests. I went to the Japanese Tea Garden and enjoyed it a lot. After visiting that, I walked all the way to the beach. The beach itself was almost too windy to enjoy, but it was definitely impressive.

## Presidio

The Presidio is an area surrounding the San Francisco side of the Golden Gate Bridge. It most notably contains an old military base/outpost that belonged to somebody. I didn't actually do that much in the Presidio, besides get to the coast to get a nice view of the Golden Gate Bridge. The base area did look interesting, but nearly everything was closed by the time I got there. The view of the Golden Gate Bridge was striking, but my attention was focused more on the bay and the general landscape and city layout rather than the bridge.

## Muir Beach Overlook and Muir Woods

Across the Golden Gate Bridge is the Golden Gate Bridge Recreation Area, which contains several towns and also interesting park-like areas. Above a town called Muir Beach is an overlook which features a great view of the Pacific Ocean as well as the California Pacific coastline landscape. Further inland, there is a large grove of Coastal Sequoia trees called Muir Woods. These Sequoia trees are rare these days, so a grove like this is pretty special. I intended to visit Muir Woods in the morning, but when I got there it was already full. So I went on to Muir Beach instead. The overlook gave me the taste of the Pacific that the beach in Golden Gate Park was unable to. Going back, I was able to get into Muir Woods and walk around for a while. Hiking up alongside the grove allowed me to really appreciate how tall the trees really are. There is still much in the recreation area that I would like to check out. I think the bay area is fortunate to have such a wonderful, activity-rich natural landscape so close by.

## Tiberon

Tiberon is a town on the bay across from San Francisco. The promenade here features a stunning view of the San Francisco skyline. The houses here are also all quite beautiful, adopting mostly sleek, modern, yet modest styles (unlike the homes in the SF hills). Getting to see the sunset from here was a fantastic way to end my favorite day in San Francisco.

## The Big SF Hill

I don't know how better to describe this area than as a big hill in the middle of downtown San Francisco. This part of downtown San Francisco features various squares and small parks, the iconic San Francisco cable cars, and lots of very steep streets. Walking around this area was interesting. I did not ride the cable cars, nor did it look like something I would enjoy. I enjoyed the small, scattered downtown parks the most. I could see myself coming here to study on nice days if I went to school in the area.

## Chinatown

Chinatown is also situated on the "big SF hill", but deserves its own treatment. It is mostly just an assortment of stores and restaurants that generally have mostly Chinese things. For some reason, I was expecting something more like a Chinese microtown in downtown San Francisco and not some tourist attraction meant to sell cheap trinkets to people looking for souvenirs. The Chinatown Culture Center was very close to what I imagined the whole of Chinatown would be like. It was nice seeing the generations of people living here all spending their time together in this open area.

Overall, the actual city parts of San Francisco disappointed me, while the parks and surrounding area impressed me. I was also surprised at how young the working population of San Francisco really is. I was walking to get dinner at around 5pm on a work day, and it was amazing to see all the people roughly my age walking around to get some dinner or make their way to public transportation.

# Yosemite

I then spent three days in/outside Yosemite National Park. Each day featured one substantial hike accompanied with a lot of marveling the sights and the general massiveness of the Yosemite Valley landscape.

## Mirror Lake Trail

This trail starts at the northeast end of Yosemite Valley and walks along the Tenaya River up to and past Mirror Lake. The whole path takes place under the flat face of the iconic Half Dome. This hike was perhaps a good introduction to what would become two and a half weeks of intermittent intermediate-tier hikes. It was mostly flat, but quite scenic with some nice views of the river and the lake and especially good views of the Half Dome on the return loop of the trip. Due to the wet winter California experienced, significant portions of the trail in the upper half were flooded to the point that it made more sense to wade through them barefoot than to try to climb and jump around in an attempt to stay dry.

## Lower and Upper Yosemite Falls

There are separate trails leading to the Lower and Upper Yosemite Falls. The trail to the lower fall is incredibly accessible and doesn't even merit mentioning. It was nice to see, but hardly an experience. The Upper Yosemite Fall trail goes up roughly 350 meters to an overlook where you can see the Upper Yosemite Falls in all their glory. Following the trail further takes you to the top of the falls. I went about two thirds of the way up to the top of falls from the overlook, but time constraints I had placed on myself prevented me from making the full hike. The trail is quite fun, and the view you get of the falls and of the valley along the way are definitely worth it. However, it is not the easiest, and there are many segments with sand on smoothly eroded stone that can be difficult and dangerous.

## Mist Trail and John Muir Trail

The Mist Trail and John Muir Trail loop takes the hiker directly past the Vernal Falls and also gives them views of the Nevada Falls and the round part of Half Dome. Initially, my plan was to just walk the Mist Trail up and down because the John Muir Trail seemed too long for my liking, but I underestimated exactly how wet I would get from the spray coming from Vernal Falls on the way up. This state of being soaked combined with coolness of the cloudy day forced me into walking the John Muir Trail back down. This turned out to be fine and probably a lot safer. I got fantastic views of the upper valley, with the mountain peaks, waterfalls, and interleaved clouds. The John Muir Trail is quite a bit longer and also goes up to a point above Vernal Falls which would not have been necessary for what I had planned. I would recommend to people looking to walk the Mist Trail to bring a change of clothes in a waterproof bag. The falls will soak you through your raincoat and if you are poorly prepared you might end up in a lot worse shape than I did. I fortunately escaped without getting sick, but had it been any colder, windier, or wetter, I would have probably needed to take a couple days to recover.

Yosemite is an incredible place and the main thing detracting from that is how big of a tourist attraction it is. There are so many people there, even in the off-season. And the more accessible parts of the park are swarming with people that have no idea what they are doing, why they are there, or why it even matters. I think Yosemite would benefit from an approach similar to Zion Canyon, where all visitors park at the beginning of the main attraction (Yosemite Valley) and take park service shuttles to various attractions. This is unfeasible for a couple reasons in Yosemite's case, the main one being, there is nowhere near the valley to park the number of people that Yosemite currently serves (or even a significant fraction of them). I still pains me to know that the most magestic of the USA's parks all suffer from this overcrowding problem, where the noise and activity distract the visitor from the magnitude and greatness of the natural wonder in front of them. Honestly, how are you supposed to feel awe when you have a basic white girl talking about her 'gram on your left, a rich, old Australian complaining about how they aren't meeting their schedule behind you, and a choir of babies crying directly to your right?

# Mono Lake

Mono Lake is a salt lake located east of Yosemite National Park. It has no outlets, so its level is the result of an equilibrium of evaporative processes and inflows from nearby mountains. It is the site of a significant restorative effort after water was diverted from the basin to be used in Los Angeles tap water. It was interesting to see the evolution of the lake overtime and especially to see the lasting positive impact appropriate necessary legal action had on the area. There were also so few people there, which left me with a profound sense of isolation.

# Death Valley

I only spent one day in Death Valley, but I did so much and was so impressed by this almost otherworldly landscape that I think it merits being treated separately like Yosemite and San Francisco.

## Dante's View

Dante's View is a mountaintop outlook with some short paths that looks over the Badwater Basin and many other iconic Death Valley features. It gives an excellent view of the landscape past Death Valley in all directions. This view is what is truly spectacular because the air is so dry there that you can actually see clearly quite far away. The outlook is accessible via car and the paths are wide and easy to hike. I would recommend this outlook to anybody that can afford a two hour detour on their path through Death Valley.

## Artist's Drive

Like much of the Southwest, the landscape formations in Death Valley often feature heavily tilted plates which reveal the various layers of rock associated with different ages when those minerals were deposited. Artist's Drive is a road that twists and dips through the foothills in front of a mountain. The entire terrain is as I described above, but notably all of the layers here have unique metals or minerals in them that paint the landscape in many different colors. It feels sometimes like you are no longer on Earth, the landscape is so weird.

## Badwater Basin

Badwater Basin is perhaps the most obvious Death Valley attraction. It is a great salt deposit in the middle of the valley. It occurs around the lowest point in the basin, making it a huge attraction to Death Valley visitors. There is a path to walk out onto the basin, which is a great experience. I was out there at about 2:00 pm, so it was quite hot. One thing that is not really mentioned about Death Valley is that the heat actually is mitigated a little by the incredible dryness and the ever present wind in the valley. It was the dryness of the air that was really surprising for me. Every bead of sweat just immediately got pulled into the air because it is so water-starved.

I didn't touch much on how alien the landscape, vegetation, and climate of Death Valley is, but it really is so strange. The landscape shifts from sand dunes to bush fields to desert with no vegetation to a literal lake of salt. The mountains, the vast expanses with just nothing, the relatively few tourists all leave you feeling that you might truly just be somewhere completely different.

# Utah and Arizona Canyons

Between Death Valley and a final stay in Las Vegas, I traveled through the incredibly varied canyon region in the middle of the southwest, mostly Utah and Arizona.

## Zion Canyon

My time in Zion Canyon was only limited to half a day, but that alone was enough to impress me. Zion Canyon is structured so that all visitors attempting to enter the scenic portion of the canyon, the main attraction, need to park at the beginning of the national park and take the parks internal shuttle service up and down the canyon. This is an *excellent* system. It lowers congestion up canyon from people driving and taking pictures and it isolates the park problem to the part of the park where parking is available everywhere. Taking the shuttle, I visited several stops walking between some of them along the riverbank. There were also two hikes I did: the first was up to Weeping Rock, which is a mountainside where water comes out along some harder rock layer and a hanging garden is formed where this stream offers sufficient moisture; the second hike was up to the emerald pool. This hike offered great views of the general canyon layout. The pools were nice, but definitely not the nicest thing to see. I did not get to hike up to Angel's Landing due to time constraints, but I plan on doing this when I return. Zion Canyon impressed me, so much so that I would consider it one of my top two favorite things on the trip.

## Kolob Canyon

On the other half of Zion Canyon National Park, there is another canyon called Kolob Canyon. It is a bit less impressive in terms of the rock walls and the stream flowing through is much less impressive, so it attracts fewer people, but that is one of its charms. While here, I hiked the Taylor Creek Trail, which takes you up the canyon along the Taylor Creek up to a hollow of sorts. This hike was incredibly scenic and peaceful. There were so few people here it was actually possible to feel isolated. While not as impressive as Zion, the rock formations here were still quite impressive, and it was one of the few locations I really felt compelled to take out my phone and take a couple pictures.

## Bryce Canyon

Bryce Canyon might be the second most iconic southwestern canyon, following the Grand Canyon, of course. And it lives up to its reputation. The amphitheatre part of the park is well shuttled, but to get out along the extended road to Rainbow Point, you have no choice but to drive. This drive along the rim is filled with many scenic views, not only of the incredible rock formations, but the general landlayout of the Grand Staircase area. The spires give way to trees and shrubs, which in turn give way to vast expanses of dry desert land.

The highlight of my time in Bryce was not the rim views or even the area around the amphitheatre. It was the Fairyland Trail hike which takes you down into the canyon and around the Boat Mesa. It is a relatively long trail and it takes you up and down a bit, but it is not technically difficult by any means. It is also much less crowded than the amphitheatre, which allows for the atmosphere to really sink in. What I mean by the atmosphere is the sense of being somewhere completely foreign. You get the sense that you might as well be on Mars with how incredible the landscape is here. The spires, the rounded canyon and mesa walls, the vegetation, the idea of the water just slowly receding and flowing to create this place makes for a great hike. This contends with Zion Canyon for my favorite experience on the trip.
