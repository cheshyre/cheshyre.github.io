I am going to try to revive this site and also make it something I can use "professionally."
For that to happen there are quite a few things I still need to do.

1. I need to add an about page.
2. I need to add a footer.
3. I need to improve the buttons for pagination.
4. I need to add a "professional" part of the website, including CV, research interests, and publication reviews.
5. I need to tackle some of the not so ideal formatting (see [style.html](/style.html)).

Some auxiliary goals are:
- Improve font choice (work with MathJax on this).
- Make color scheme a bit more vibrant.

Let's see how quickly I can get this done.
