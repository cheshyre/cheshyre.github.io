I had been planning to take some time to redo my personal website for a while, but really never felt motivated enough to do it. But finally I managed to find some time to work on it, and with a little perseverance and a lot of help from Desch I think I've mostly completed what I want to do. I still have to write out the HLTB part of the site, and the Guides part of the site will probably be very empty for a very long time, because writing guides is a pain in the ass. However, the blog should probably work fine, so I'll start using that to write about things. If you have thoughts on how I can improve the site, feel free to contact me through one of the media explained in the [About](/about.html) page. Hopefully, you will find some of the content on here either interesting or useful.
