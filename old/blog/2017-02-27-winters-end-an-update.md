It seems about time to give another update so I'll offer up my concerns on various things I've been thinking about recently.

### Video Games

I can sort of feel my enjoyment of video games waning, much in the same way my love of k-pop and anime has waned over the past year. I still play games, but the experiences I get feel less and less fresh, and when they are different, it's often not in a good way. Perhaps this will just be a short phase and I'll get back to dumping my entire free time into video games, but for the time being I'm turning to reading news, watching TV shows I never bothered watching, and even reading textbooks. I've even thought about picking up a cardio sport like sprinting or swimming again (an odd idea given that I am currently trying to put on muscle and cardio works against that). But perhaps this is a long-term shift away from the fantasy worlds that sheltered me when I was younger and towards the absurd, terrifying reality that we live in today. I am exaggerating a bit, but I think the last year has forced me to grow up a lot. I now have a lot of planning and options weighing to do, and perhaps escaping to another fake world with problems that conveniently fit who I am and what I can do is just not something that aligns well with dealing with today's issues. I don't know what to think.

### Matters of Taste

Whenever I see somebody enjoy different things from what I enjoy, I am forced to reconcile what I want to say and do with what I really think about differing tastes. I believe taste is subjective and it is hard to tell people not to like what they like. However, I think there are objective measures of quality for entertainment such as consistency and loyalty to a vision and many other things that I am unqualified to talk about. I like to think that my own taste mirrors things that are also objectively well-made (perhaps not all things, but the things I do like I feel I can argue for quality in somewhat objective terms). However, often when people talk about liking something or not liking something, I feel the need to dispute their opinions, despite it not being my place to interfere. This desire to be vocal in my dissent correlates to how vocal they are in their taste. I don't actually have anything to say here, but it's troubling to me how poorly I am able to translate what I think into how I react or feel.

### Physics: LLNL and GREs

I got a job offer at Lawrence Livermore National Lab in California for the summer. I will be working to use Bayesian statistics to understand jet-quenching in high-energy ion collisions and what these results say about the structure of the matter from which these jets radiate. I am excited (and scared) to do something completely different for a summer. It will interesting to see what I can accomplish and how the national lab setting as a whole treats me.

I also have to study for my physics GRE, which means I have to relearn a lot of material that I haven't touched for two or three years. Physics as a whole is conceptually simple, but the issue is that problems can get very dirty very fast if certain symmetries are no longer there and certain considerations are made. My fear is that I will be asked to do problems that I will not have had the recent experience to approach correctly and as a result I will do poorly. I think I can prepare well, but there is always that sliver of doubting lingering in the back of my mind.
