The Dark Souls franchise is well-known for several reasons, including the story that the game leaves the player to unravel, the brutal difficulty and lack of handholding that makes the games so inaccessible to new players, the world that fits together so incredibly tightly (the best example of this is Dark Souls), boss battles that are difficult, yet stunning, atmospheric, and carry weight in so many ways, and so many other things. I'd like to take some time to discuss the bosses from the Dark Souls series (so excluding Demon's Souls and Bloodborne, which do not really take place in the same world). While I could handle this many different ways, I'll just keep it simple and give my top 10 favorite bosses followed by a discussion how each separate installment in the series differs in boss style and how the game is built around those bosses.

10. Manus, Father of the Abyss (Dark Souls: Artorias of the Abyss DLC)
9. Fume Knight (Dark Souls 2: Crown of the Old Iron King DLC)
8. Bell Gargoyles (Dark Souls)
7. Sinh, the Slumbering Dragon (Dark Souls 2: Crown of the Sunken King DLC)
6. Knight Artorias (Dark Souls: Artorias of the Abyss DLC)
5. Lothric and Lorian, the Twin Princes (Dark Souls 3)
4. Dancer of the Boreal Valley (Dark Souls 3)
3. Dragonslayer Ornstein and Executioner Smough (Dark Souls)
2. Gwyn, Lord of Cinder (Dark Souls)
1. Abyss Watchers (Dark Souls 3)

The ranking above is mostly based on the atmosphere and the combat of the fight, not the lore. While I care deeply about the Dark Souls lore, my first experience with most bosses is usually independent of that. I do the fight and appreciate the context afterwards. And I don't feel that impedes the experience at all. In fact, I think it speaks to the game design that so much of how it communicates the significance of encounters with entities in the game outside of the walls of text that are item descriptions. I feel like I should mention this: while I feel that certain Dark Souls 2 DLC bosses are good, I actually feel no motivation to seek those fights out again, thanks to the majority of the game being trash.

So now on to how each installment in general approaches bosses and the design of the game around them.

### Dark Souls

The first half of Dark Souls is pretty close to my idea of the ideal gaming experience. The game encourages the player to explore the world to locate the two Bells of Awakening and it teaches the player about the game and how to survive along the way. While the beginning bosses may not stand out as particularly epic or difficult, they are very diverse and offer the player an idea of how the world is. While the end-game of Dark Souls is a struggle against the remains of the Age of Lords, the early-game is a struggle against the "natural" state of the world, a world of deformed, wild, inexplicable beings. Unfortunately, the Dark Souls experience declines significantly after Ornstein and Smough, thanks to certain areas being obviously unfinished and other areas really not living up to the potential they had. This is all sort of remedied by the quality of the final boss in the series, but in a lot of ways I really dislike playing past Anor Londo simply because the game falls off so hard for a while. However, the first part of Dark Souls truly remains the ideal for any game in terms of world design and how the different parts fit together so intricately.

### Dark Souls: Artorias of the Abyss DLC

After starting with one of the worst fights in the entire game (Sanctuary Guardian), the Dark Souls DLC becomes one of the most fantastic experiences in the game. Albeit fairly linear, the DLC covers the tragedy of Knight Artorias, the knight of Gwyn who dared to challenge the spread of the Abyss, yet eventually succumbed to it. The three fights following the Sanctuary Guardian are each excellent, and the progression from the woods to the corrupted township to the Chasm of the Abyss that is slowly consuming the world around it gives the player's experience a driving force. This DLC is amazing, and is probably the best DLC for a Dark Souls game so far.

### Dark Souls 2

In a nutshell, I think Dark Souls 2 is a bad game. Not just a good game that doesn't live up to Dark Souls' standard, but a legitimately bad video game experience. This is definitely true if you do not consider the DLC (which adds some good levels and a mix of good and bad bosses). The name of the game for DS2 is quantity over quality, and this is unfortunate because there are quite honestly only two or three bosses out of the base game that stand out at all. The rest seem to be either describable as trivial or terrible. The levels guide the player from boss to boss in a linear fashion, and the world doesn't fit together at all. And in the end you're rewarded with some more extremely bad fights. If it weren't for the fact that Dark Souls 3 actually makes references back to Dark Souls 2, I would never touch the game again.

### Dark Souls 2 DLC

I will talk about all of the DLCs as a whole, even though they are all pretty different. In general, the Dark Souls 2 DLCs match the Dark Souls DLC in style much more than they match the base game. The levels are well designed, though the experience for each of them ends up being mostly linear (this seems hard to avoid for a DLC that is independent of the original game). The bosses are mixture of good and bad. Some of the good fights include Sinh, Fume Knight, Burnt Ivory King, and Sir Alonne. Some of the bad fights include Mytha, three man gank squad, and the King's Pets. While I like the Smelter Demon fight, I think that placing almost the exact same boss in a DLC is a sign of laziness more than anything else, and I found that really disappointing. I also think the solo King's pet fight is okay, but the fact that the other boss fight is just a copy of the first fight but with two of them is just (simply put) really fucking lame. For how much people said I'd love the DLC, it didn't live up to the hype. I don't think evne the good parts of the DLC are worth wading through the shit for.

### Dark Souls 3

Dark Souls 3 features the most consistent quality fights of the entire series. However, the game's main downfall is that the progression through the world is basically linear (at least until fairly late in the game). It is this linearity that also guarantees that the player will experience the game a certain way, which allows for the incredible dramatic build-up towards the end of the game. In some ways, this could not work in a world so open and explorable as Dark Souls, since the player would probably spend more time being lost than actually progressing and thus further building up the tension. I don't know exactly how to feel about it, but I think the atmosphere Dark Souls 3 has towards the end of the game is fantastic, and the combat is really good (minus the whole no-poise thing). All in all, thanks to active multi-player and faster combat, I think Dark Souls 3 will be the Dark Souls game I spend the most time on. And I really am loooking forward to the DLC that will be released in Autumn 2016.
