After discovering that my last blog layout didn't really play well with mobile browsing, I grew frustrated and gave up. However, a recent desire to find something new to distract myself from schoolwork and responsibilities led to me giving this whole website thing another chance. This is in a sense the final result of those efforts, but not really. For the time being, I've basically just glued together a mediocre, mobile-friendly site using Foundation, and with a little help from Desch and Kyhz, it seems to be working as intended. I plan to take a step back after this and learn exactly how this works from the bottom up, so I don't have to rely on frontend frameworks like foundation in the future. However, seeing as I'm definitely not the fastest learner when it comes to web dev things, that will probably be a while, so for the forseeable future, this is how the blog will look.

I also plan on starting to write the TS guide, not because I think unanimated's guide is incomplete, and not really because I think it's outdated (even though in a sense it is), but because I think it will help me reassess my approach to typesetting and maybe open me up to new ways of working on things. There's also a possibility that someone might find it useful, so that would be cool.
