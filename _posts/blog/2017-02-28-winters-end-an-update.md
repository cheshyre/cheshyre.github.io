If you actually frequent this website, you will notice that I've retired all of the blog content. There are a couple reasons for this. First, I wasn't very happy with what I was writing; it seemed to me like I was just complaining about things without going anywhere or making anything meaningful out of it. It wasn't even helping me deal with the issues I was discussing (most likely because I don't think anybody actually reads this blog). Second, this site is constantly undergoing a redesign that may or may not actually roll out someday. I've decided to "nuke" the posts in order to give me as much flexibility as I'd like with the redesign without needing to support old content that may or may not fit into the new site layout.

So, for the time being, I won't be doing anything on here. Ideally, I will just work on my site locally and eventually, once I've built a site that I find appealing in terms of appearance, content, organization, etc. I'll roll it out and start posting things again. As I told some of my friends, this whole website thing was never about me posting things. It was for me to learn about what goes into making a website and figuring out how to make something I am happy with. Considering this, even after "completing" an initial redesign, I will still probably iterate on the design to adjust things and make it better as I learn more. I guess the work really never does end, huh?
