Here are some things going through my mind in no particular order.

# Trump's Presidency

Let me preface this bit by saying that I am in a position of extraordinary privilege currently. I hate the term privilege, but it is the only way to accurately describe my situation as the American political and overall climate transforms with the new administration. I am a male, white, straight, young, with a STEM degree, and dual citizenship (which affords me an easy way out if I ever want it). The only sense in which I am close to directly affected is by the changes in funding for scientists in academia that will take place as the new administration reconsiders spending and the value of research. But I still have a lot of mobility, immunity, and no threats pointed my way, unlike many other people. In light of all this, it may be easy for me to say what I am about to say, but it doesn't change the fact that after months of thinking about the Trump presidency and discussing it with my friends (many of whom belong to minorities targeted by Trump's campaign) and family this is how I feel. 

I believe Trump should be given the room to set the direction for the government under his administration. I understand that for many that seems scary, especially consider all he has said. However, I believe that complicated, inefficient, rusty machine that is Capitol Hill will statistically speaking act as an emergency brake for Trump's pain train. He will need to at least unify Republicans in Congress behind his plans and that alone will be hard enough. There is also something to be said for the confidence people like Obama and other legislators have in the structure of the American government that makes me believe that Trump won't be able to do too much damage. It just seems extreme to me to be saying *now* that we better work to ensure our democracy stays intact, as if Trump has set out to destroy it. So I believe it is our job to keep an open eye on what the government is doing, to vote every year for politicians we believe best mirror our own interests (not exactly, but to first order or something), not to close our eyes, plug our ears, and wall off our hearts. By doing the latter, that is how we truly let democracy die.

# 2NE1's Good-bye And A Look Back

2NE1's disbanding was announced a while ago, but just today the group released one last song, titled [Good-bye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEkLHC7l25w). The song features one of 2NE1's best backing tracks, acoustic, slow, allowing the group's vocal strength to shine. Ironically, the focus placed on CL throughout the video reflects a direction decision YG made that I believe was an error. 2NE1 being a four-member group meant that members really wouldn't have to fight for the spotlight, so to speak. However, in recent years, CL's solo career and the shift of attention from other members to CL even in group settings signalled a change in the group (not unlike Hyuna and 4MINUTE). Good-bye is a good song though, and Dara looks fantastic, so I would recommend checking it out.

Looking back on 2NE1's time active, I'm not sure how to feel. On one hand, 2NE1 is an iconic group in the Korean scene, and some of their songs are still excellent and pretty unique. On the other hand, many of their songs are not very interesting, and while Crush was a fairly good album as a whole, I feel like 2NE1 failed to capitalize on their strengths. For example, I really like Missing You, I Love You besides the end, Gotta Be You, and the reggae/unplugged versions whereever they existed. But at the same time, I really dislike Fire, I Am The Best, and Can't Nobody. I feel like 2NE1 focused so hard on rap and just being a "bad girl group" that they strayed from what they did best (CL's vocals are much, much better than her raps). I won't miss 2NE1, but their end sort of signals a shift in the world of Korean girl groups. 2NE1 was sort of unique in that it was a small group made up of members who each had *unique* strengths. With groups like 2NE1 and 4MINUTE going the way of the dinosaur, the current trend has shifted to girl groups with lots of members, where roles aren't even close to unique and the focus tends to be on including as many personalities into groups as possible. There exist some exceptions of course, like Red Velvet and f(x), but as a whole the scene is tending in that direction, which I personally think is unfortunate. Anyway, RIP 2NE1. CL will probably continue her solo career forever so, unfortunately, we'll see her around.

# Music in General

It's no secret that I'm interested in Korean pop music. K-Pop and I have been on and off since my junior year of high school, and my most recent high has been for the past nine months or so. During this time, I've opened my eyes and ears and listened to as much (mainstream) Korean music as I could, which was a lot of fun. I found a lot of groups that I really enjoy, but in general it's also made me pretty cynical about how much crap comes out of the K-Pop scene. As you would expect, I've burned out on K-Pop, for the most part. Especially AOA... I really don't care about AOA, but Seolhyun...

 My new interest is hip-hop. I got into hip-hop (again) because of Kanye's most recent album, The Life of Pablo. Since then I've started working my way back from present day, listening to many albums, aiming to get a comprehensive image of the hip-hop scene going back to artists like Run DMC. Hip-hop is fun though. Five recommendations I'd give off the top of my head are: My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy - Kanye West, Telefone - Noname, Jeffery - Young Thug, good kid m.a.a.d city - Kendrick Lamar, and The College Dropout - Kanye West. There's still a lot I haven't listened to, but I'd say for a casual like me, this is a good place to start.

# Health, School, Life

I've been placing an emphasis on living healthier recently. My diet has been very clean for four or five months at this point, but I've focused on drinking more water and getting seven to eight hours of sleep a night. These have both been good for me. So I'd recommend it to other people; watch two episodes anime less or just don't play a game of LoL in the evening and get some more sleep. Your body and mind will thank you. Trust me.

This post probably wasn't very well-written, especially since I haven't been sober since inauguration, but it feels good to put some of these things in writing. And I seriously don't think this unconditional resistance approach to Trump is constructive at all. @ me if you disagree.
