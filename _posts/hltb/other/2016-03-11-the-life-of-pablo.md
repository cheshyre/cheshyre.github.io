### Review

Many very good reviews have been written about this album, but I will quickly explain here what I find so fascinating about The Life of Pablo.

Kanye's music had never appealed to me in the past. Actually, no, the media surrounding Kanye had never appealed to me. The only songs I had ever heard were All of the Lights (which I still don't really like) and Power (which I think is quite good). I automatically associated Kanye with everything I didn't care for about the genre of hip-hop (egomania, seeking out conflict, everything in excess, etc). However, the disorganized and uncertain nature of the release of The Life of Pablo drew me in, and I took the time out of my day to give the album a listen. And that first listen clued me in to how incredibly wrong I was in my judgements of Kanye and his music.

Kanye has stated that Pablo is supposed to be a "gospel album," and the first track, Ultralight Beam, suggests that it might in fact be a gospel album in the traditional sense. And yet there is not a single track after the first that would be classified as gospel in the traditional sense. So is it really a gospel album? Not really, but throughout Pablo Kanye oscillates heavily between tones of insecurity and despar and tones of faith and self-confidence. While it may not be an ode to God's power, Kanye paints the picture of himself, his vulnerabilities and temptations, his beliefs and foundation, and in the end the album as a whole is a dismissal of his "vices" and a proclamation of the things that keep him grounded. If this doesn't sound like the making of a gospel album, then I don't know what is.

I could speak to the unique musical style Kanye continues to develop, but then again I don't have nearly enough training to say anything decently informed. But The Life of Pablo is truly incredible, and I encourage everyone to listen to it at least once. This album opened the door for me to look back on Kanye's previous music, and I have enjoyed discovering the different Kanye eras and their associated moods.
