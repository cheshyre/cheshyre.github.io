# Renormalized

Welcome to my personal site. While I am not particularly interested in writing much, occasionally I will use this to say things that I feel need to be said, usually relating to topics in physics, music, and computer science. The primary goal of the site, however, is for me to get some hands on experience in developing a lean, optimized, yet feature-rich, static site.

## Goals

### Long-term

- Styling
- Service workers
- Javascript science demos (double pendulum, Ising model)

### Short-term

- Meta tags
- Decisions regarding images
- Decisions regarding categories
