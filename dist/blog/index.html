I found that naive physics intuition gives reasonable intuition about expectation values, but I wanted to learn more about how to formally deal with such a system. In the end, I arrived at a result through some methods from stochastic processes, which I showcase here.</div></div><div class="post_index"><div class="post_title"><h1><a href="/travel/2018/10/30/trip-to-gero-from-takayama.html">Tips for a Trip to Gero from Takayama</a></h1></div><p class="post_author"> <span class="date">October 30, 2018</span></p><div class="post_excerpt"><p>When I visited Takayama, I noticed how unclear the literature surrounding going to Gero to bathe in the hot spring baths there was.

I’ve more or less explicitly stated somewhere (probably on Twitter) that fansubbing was a pretty positive thing for me; I got to know a bunch of great people, make some good friends, and learn some skills that I hadn’t picked up before (including social skills that are fairly broadly applicable, I think). And yet, something about the whole thing feels incomplete, and I think this incompleteness is what brings me back to thinking about fansubbing so much. I want to walk through how I thought about fansubbing and how those ideas were reflected in my actions, a story I will tell in three parts.</p></div></div><div class="post_index"><div class="post_title"><h1><a href="/physics/2018/05/25/april-aps-meeting-review.html">Quarks to Cosmos - APS April Meeting Review: A Defense of Globalism</a></h1></div><p class="post_author"> <span class="date">May 25, 2018</span></p><div class="post_excerpt"><p>This post is a little over a month late, but while I was sitting through some of the talks at the April APS meeting, I thought that I should put some of my ideas about it in writing.

Typically, I talk these things over with my friends or rant on my Twitter instead of writing a post for these things, but because my friends enjoy the game so much and because some of my followers are trying really hard to avoid spoilers, writing these things into the void is the most utilitarian way for me to get these thoughts off my mind. For those unaware of what Monster Hunter is about, it’s a pretty simple concept. You kill monsters and take their parts to make better gear so you can fight stronger monsters. If I had to give another game similar to the Monster Hunter concept, I’d offer up World of Warcraft and Vindictus as two games that share a lot of general features with monster hunter. I think the similarities between Vindictus and Monster Hunter are pretty obvious, but not many people have played Vindictus, so I figured I’d offer up WoW, where I think the sense of gear progression and content progression is pretty similar to Monster Hunter.</p></div></div></div><div class="pagination"><h3 class="page_number ">Page 1 of 3</h3> <a href="/blog/page2" class="button next">2</a></div></div></body></html>
