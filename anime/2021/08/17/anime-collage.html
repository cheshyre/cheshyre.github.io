Here are five shows that highlight most of what I like in the shows I watch.</p><h2 id="flcl">FLCL</h2><p><img src="/assets/images/post/2021-anime-collage/flcl_cover.jpg" alt="FLCL" title="FLCL"/></p><p>FLCL is (depending on the day) my favorite show of all time. It scratches the “coming of age” itch as well as the action anime itch, but I additionally value that the setting is based in the real world, which I enjoy more than high fantasy these days. It is a short, but densely-packed, and each episode can be watched individually without feeling lost or yearning to watch more.</p><p>Similar shows that I also enjoy are: JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure - Part 4: Diamond is Unbreakable and Gurren Lagann.</p><h2 id="mushishi">Mushishi</h2><p><img src="/assets/images/post/2021-anime-collage/mushishi_cover.jpg" alt="Mushishi" title="Mushishi"/></p><p>Mushishi covers the episodic, adventure genre, but it also illustrates my enjoyment of shows that show a deep reverence for the natural world. Watching Mushishi is a satisfying slow drip where each episode gives you a new premise to dig into and something different to think about.</p><p>Similar shows/movies that I also enjoy are: Cowboy Bebop, Princess Mononoke, and Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind.</p><h2 id="ping-pong-the-animation">Ping Pong The Animation</h2><p><img src="/assets/images/post/2021-anime-collage/ping_pong_cover.jpg" alt="Ping Pong The Animation" title="Ping Pong The Animation"/></p><p>Ping Pong is an excellent sports anime. It is somewhat unique in its scope combined with its relatively short length (11 episodes), and it also is more focused on individual training, skill, and passion rather than the teamwork themes that saturate the genre.</p><p>Similar shows that I also enjoy are: Free!, Hajime no Ippo, Megalobox, and Haikyuu!!.</p><h2 id="my-teen-romantic-comedy-snafu">My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU</h2><p><img src="/assets/images/post/2021-anime-collage/snafu_cover.jpg" alt="SNAFU" title="SNAFU"/></p><p>Surprisingly, I also have grown to enjoy romantic comedies and more standard-setting comedies. SNAFU is my favorite show in this general swath of genres; it is self-aware and self-deprecating (in ways that are unfortunately very relatable), and it combines drama and comedy excellently to portray a misanthrope’s experiences in high school society.</p><p>Similar shows that I also enjoy are: New Game!, Maid-Sama!, and Daily Lives of High School Boys.</p><h2 id="the-tatami-galaxy">The Tatami Galaxy</h2><p><img src="/assets/images/post/2021-anime-collage/tatami_galaxy_cover.jpg" alt="The Tatami Galaxy" title="The Tatami Galaxy"/></p><p>Tatami Galaxy covers a class of shows that I would classify as visually distinct and dialogue-heavy. This categorization is pretty generic, but I feel like Tatami Galaxy and the other shows I consider similar to it all have very similar viewing experiences despite massive differences in setting and plot structures. For Tatami Galaxy, the story is about a boy in college who relives the same year of his life over and over on the way to his supposedly fated social encounter. It is episodic in a way, allowing for easy watching habits, but the overarching narrative drives everything forwards in a way that doesn’t happen for the Mushishi-class of episodic shows. Additionally, it has a strong visual style that is exploited to enhance the storytelling, and its defining feature is probably how heavy the dialogue is.</p><p>Similar shows that I also enjoy are: Bakemonogatari and Katanagatari.</p></div></div></body></html>
