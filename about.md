### Who am I?

Online I go by two aliases which I use interchangeably, cheshyre and Ephemere. I am a student currently studying physics and computer science with a focus on the high-performance computing side of physics (particularly in the context of nuclear theory). I have lots of hobbies including: mathematics, video games, anime, traveling, working out, and fansubbing.

### What is this site?

This site exists mostly for me to have a place where I can write about issues I think are important or interesting. Thus, what I write about will be mostly focused on topics related what I am studying and researching and topics related to my hobbies. I am sure that I will make the occasional post on political or social issues, but those won't be consistent at all.

### How can you reach me?

I am best contacted on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter }}). If you have an account, feel free to mention me in a tweet or message me directly to get my attention. Another option is to find me on IRC on Rizon. Typically the only public channel I will be in is #irrational-typesetting-wizardry, so if you join that channel you can either highlight me there or send me a personal message to get my attention.
