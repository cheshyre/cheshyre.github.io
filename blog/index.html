Here are five shows that highlight most of what I like in the shows I watch.</p></div></div><div class="post_index"><div class="post_title"><h1><a href="/dev/2021/08/03/site-update-04.html">Site Update 4: Features to Implement</a></h1></div><p class="post_author"> <span class="date">August 03, 2021</span></p><div class="post_excerpt"><p>I am going to try to revive this site and also make it something I can use “professionally.” For that to happen there are quite a few things I still need to do.</p></div></div><div class="post_index"><div class="post_title"><h1><a href="/physics/2019/01/06/bounded-random-walk-problem.html">The Bounded Random Walk</a></h1></div><p class="post_author"> <span class="date">January 06, 2019</span></p><div class="post_excerpt"><p>I discuss a new problem I encountered through my brother, the bounded random walk. I found that naive physics intuition gives reasonable intuition about expectation values, but I wanted to learn more about how to formally deal with such a system. In the end, I arrived at a result through some methods from stochastic processes, which I showcase here.</p></div></div><div class="post_index"><div class="post_title"><h1><a href="/travel/2018/10/30/trip-to-gero-from-takayama.html">Tips for a Trip to Gero from Takayama</a></h1></div><p class="post_author"> <span class="date">October 30, 2018</span></p><div class="post_excerpt"><p>When I visited Takayama, I noticed how unclear the literature surrounding going to Gero to bathe in the hot spring baths there was.

I’ve more or less explicitly stated somewhere (probably on Twitter) that fansubbing was a pretty positive thing for me; I got to know a bunch of great people, make some good friends, and learn some skills that I hadn’t picked up before (including social skills that are fairly broadly applicable, I think). And yet, something about the whole thing feels incomplete, and I think this incompleteness is what brings me back to thinking about fansubbing so much. I want to walk through how I thought about fansubbing and how those ideas were reflected in my actions, a story I will tell in three parts.</p></div></div></div><div class="pagination"><h3 class="page_number ">Page 1 of 3</h3> <a href="/blog/page2" class="button next">2</a></div></div></body></html>
