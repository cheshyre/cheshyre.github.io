NU ABO</h2><p>This song emphasizes the points I mentioned about the tone set for f(x) on this album better than any other on the album: the verses are delivered pointedly and quickly; the instrumental features various synths and samples uncharacteristic of pop music, such as the ubiquitous cheering sample; the vocals are distorted throughout and repitched vocals are used to generate harmonies at the ends of verse lines and in the chorus. The vocal cleanliness of the bridge (without distortion and the echo added to give volume to the vocals) comes as a pleasant surprise and serves to juxtapose the song with other more prevalent sounds used in Korean pop.</p><p>The song’s weakest point is by far the overused cheering sample, which fills in various parts of the song for reasons completely unclear to me. Dialing back the use of this sample would leave the song much improved, even if it is a bit too noisy for me. The distorted vocals seem to have to fight a battle with the chaotic instrumental, even just to assert their own rhythm as the dominant one in the track.</p><h2 id="2-mr-boogie">2. Mr. Boogie</h2><p>Mr. Boogie is the essentail NU ABO track, in that it perfectly illustrates the concept f(x) is looking to present without erring into the territory of discord. Sharp drums, layered synth lines, ear-pricking samples, and unique vocals all make their appearance without coming into conflict. The track is in no way true to its name in that it has no real traces of “boogie” influence, but that doesn’t matter; f(x) has created an essentially perfect experimental female synth-pop track here that expertly showcases what they and their producers are capable of.</p><h2 id="3-ice-cream">3. Ice Cream</h2><p>If NU ABO is the overengingeered version of the core f(x) concept presented here, Ice Cream is the stripped back, minimalistic version of it. The instrumental is unambitious, looking to leave space for the vocals to do, which they do for the majority of the song. f(x) show their ability to sing their lines in harmony with the instrumental while still carrying the song by offering interesting rhythms and melodic twists. The rap portion of the bridge is by far the worst part of the song. Amber’s flow is uninteresting, several lines delivered in English are corny as hell, and the rap truly brings the flow of the entire song to a halt. The following singing part of the bridge serves well to usher in a smooth return of the chorus, but this low could have been avoided entirely.</p><h2 id="4-meu">4. ME+U</h2><p>ME+U, much like Mr. Boogie, represents the NU ABO album concept executed to near perfection. The driving baseline, the solid drums, and the occasionally visiting higher synth lines frame the chanty verses in the song well. The chorus features various tastefully used vocal samples. The main chorus vocals feature filled in backing harmonics which give emphasis to the correct parts of the lines. Once again, the clean bridge offers the listener’s brain a quick rest before showing off some Kanye-esque autotune vocal riffs. They do an exceptional job of keeping the listener off guard. This is taken to a questionable extreme at the very end of the song, where for four measures the key of the song inexplicably drops down a half-step. However, ME+U remains an excellent example of the concept of the album, and unfortunately it is also the last.</p><h2 id="5-surprise-party">5. Surprise Party</h2><p>Surprise Party is a clean, bubbly pop track, that showcases in some sense f(x)’s ability to match these generic pop sounds. Later verses drop hints of the experimental sound left behind, but never fully commit. The song is for the most part unoffensive, well-executed and yet completely uninteresting, except for a vocal riff at the end of the chorus which features a texture addition added 100% using autotune that sounds absolutely terrible. Surprise Party probably works fine as a generic bubble pop song, but fails to fit into the sonic continuum of the album, and quite frankly fails to be interesting at all.</p><h2 id="6-sorry-dear-daddy">6. Sorry (Dear. Daddy)</h2><p>Sorry is a ballad and comes with all of the baggage that ballads typically come with: 2nd and 4th measure emphasis, slow piano arpeggios, backing strings, and clean, dramatic vocals. In my opinion, f(x) performs well on this song. Most verses and the chorus are delivered well. The arrangement lacks for the most part irregularities, which would probably seem quite out of place. However, their absence accentuates how predictable the song is, rhythmically and compositionally. The ballad does not fit into the album well, and, even worse, it fails to make a strong case for its own existence.</p><h1 id="highs">Highs</h1><p>NU ABO’s strengths lie in the tracks that embrace the album/group concept put forth in the first two thirds of the album. Even though I think NU ABO is too noisy and overambitious, in the larger picture, it still stands as a high point on the album along with the other tracks mentioned. Mr. Boogie really stands out as the best point on the album. Everything about the track, from the perfectly delivered vocals to the “shattered glass” sample used to complete musical phrases in the beat, comes together to create an essential f(x) track. It also marks the beginning of the highest highs on the album; the following tracks, Ice Cream and ME+U, are also quite good and fit in quite well after Mr. Boogie.</p><h1 id="lows">Lows</h1><p>NU ABO’s lack of convincing conclusion is perhaps its weakest feature. Surprise Party and Sorry (Dear. Daddy) offer nothing in the way of tying up loose ends on the album. In fact, they don’t fit into the rest of the album at all. It seems they function rather as a showcase for f(x)’s ability to match the songs other groups write. But they don’t do anything more than match those generic concepts on these tracks. There is no essential f(x) flavor and the songs could just as easily have come from any other semi-versatile girl group.</p><h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1><p>NU ABO offers us a convincing presentation of what f(x) might possibly be about. Between the ballads and bubble pop, we find the development of a strong artistic concept that leaves us looking to later LPs and EPs for more.</p></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
